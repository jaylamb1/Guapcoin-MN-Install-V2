# How to Install a Masternode Using Existing GUAP

For those that are interested please see below instructions for setting up a MN on your desktop wallet using your existing GUAP. Setting up a masternode requires creating a masternode wallet on a virtual private server and setting up a masternode controller on your desktop wallet.

#### Background Info on MN (skip if you are familiar with MNs and their general setup)
  A masternode is simply a node (or wallet: remember that each wallet that is on and connected to the GUAP network becomes a node in the blockchain) that is always on and connected, and takes on certain important roles on the blockchain (such as facilitating instant transactions) and in return gets a reward from time to time.

  The most secure way to run a masternode is to use two wallets (this is standard and suggested setup used for GUAP). First there is a cold wallet where you lock up your 10,000 GUAP and receive the MN rewards (this is the masternode controller and is typically your desktop wallet), and second there is the hot wallet that is the 24/7 always connected wallet that usually runs on a virtual private server (this is the masternode). 

  Both are needed, but once setup and started the cold wallet (which is your desktop wallet) need not be on all the time, and really only needs to be opened once in a while to sync to the blockchain and collect all your rewards earned since the last sync. For the masternode (the always on hot wallet) you need only about single core 1Ghz machine with about 2GB of ram and 10-20GB in storage available.

  HOWEVER, the hot wallet needs to been connected to the internet and the blockchain all the time, so relying on your home internet connection for this purpose puts your masternode and the GUAP network at risk (remember that masternodes contribute to the robustness and speed of the GUAP network). Best practice is to run the masternode from a virtual private server on a service like vultr.com or digitalocean.com . Right now it cost about $10/month to run a VPS on Vultr with those specs and get your masternode going (these are linux systems and the linux versions of the wallet run on Ubunut 16.04 and Ubuntu 18.04). The cold wallet (desktop wallet) can run on any Mac or PC made within the last 5 years without any issue.

#### See full instructions below.

NOTE: Note that these instructions are provided AS IS, do not provide for every eventuality or problem that might arise, do not include every detail of every sub-step, and you are on your own regarding support or fixes related to using these instructions. Also note that your VPS is a linux system that will need to be periodically updated and maintained, and your masternode wallet is linux application that will sometimes have issues and possibly crash just like any other piece of software. There’s a multitude of resources available online for maintaining the performance and security of linux systems and applications. I suggest getting familiar with them.

Now onto the instructions.




## 1. First you must setup a virtual private server:

### System requirements - USE AN UBUNTU LINUX 16.04 or 18.04 VPS for best results.

The VPS you plan to install your masternode on needs to have at least 2GB of RAM and 10GB of free disk space. We do not recommend using servers who do not meet those criteria because your masternode may become stable. 

We also recommend you do not use elastic cloud services like AWS or Google Cloud for your masternode - to use your node with such a service would require some networking knowledge and manual configuration. Vultr and DigitalOcean are good options.




## 2. Then you need to fund your node:
### Funding your Masternode.

First, we will do the initial collateral TX and send exactly 10000 GUAP to one of our addresses. 
To keep things sorted in case we setup more masternodes we will label the addresses we use.

- Open your GUAP wallet and switch to the “Receive” tab.

- Click into the label field and create a label, I will use “MN1".

- Now click on “Request payment”.

The generated address will now be labelled as MN1. If you want to setup more masternodes just repeat the steps above so you end up with several addresses for the total number of nodes you wish to setup. Example: For 10 nodes you will need 10 addresses (make sure you label them all).

Once all addresses are created send 10000 GUAP each to them. Ensure that you send exactly 10000 GUAP and do it in a single transaction. You can double check where the coins are coming from by checking it via coin control usually, that’s not an issue.

As soon as all 10K transactions are done, we will wait for 15 confirmations. You can check this in your wallet or use the explorer. It should take around 30 minutes if all transaction have 15 confirmations.



## 3. Installation & Setting up your Masternode Controller
### Generate your Masternode Private Key.

- In your wallet, open Settings -> Debug -> Console and run the following command to get your masternode key:
    > createmasternodekey

    Please note: If you plan to set up more than one masternode, you need to create a key with the above command for each one.

- Run this command to get your output information:
    > getmasternodeoutputs

- Copy both the key and output information to a text file.

### Add your Masternode Key and Txid to masternode.conf.
- Close your wallet and open the Guapcoin Appdata folder. Its location depends on your OS.

    Windows: Press Windows+R and write %appdata% - there, open the folder Guapcoin.

    macOS: Press Command+Space to open Spotlight, write ~/Library/Application Support/Guapcoin and press Enter.

    Linux: Open ~/.Guapcoin/

- In your appdata folder, open masternode.conf with a text editor and add a new line in this format to the bottom of the file:

    *masternodename ipaddress:9633 genkey collateralTxID outputID*

    An example would be:
    
    *mn1 127.0.0.2:9633 93HaYBVUCYjEMeeH1Y4sBGLALQZE1Y 2bcd3c84c84f87eaa86e4e56834c929 0*

    *masternodename* is a name you choose, *ipaddress* is the public IP of your VPS, *genkey* is the output from runnning the `createmasternodekey` command earlier, and collateralTxID & outputID come from running the `getmasternodeoutputs` earlier. Please note that *masternodename* must not contain any spaces, and should not contain any special characters.
    
- Restart and unlock your wallet.



## 4. Install Masternode wallet on the VPS

- SSH into to your VPS server (using Putty on Windows, Terminal.app on macOS, or any other ssh client of your choice), login as root (Please note: It’s normal that you don’t see your password after typing or pasting it) and run the following command:

  `bash <( curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guapcrypto/Guapcoin-MN-Install-V2/master/GUAP-v2-Ubuntu1604.sh )`


  The above command assumes that you chose Ubuntu 16.04 for your VPS. If you instead setup your VPS as Ubuntu 18.04 the masternode installer for Ubuntu 18.04 can be found here: https://github.com/guapcrypto/Guapcoin-MN-Install-V2

- When the script asks, confirm your VPS IP Address and paste in your masternode key (You can copy your key and paste into the VPS if connected with Putty by right clicking)

- The installer will then present you with a few options.
Follow the instructions on screen.

- After the basic installation is done, the wallet will sync.

- Once you see “Masternode setup completed.” on screen, you are done.
